# DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALGORITHM OR SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING ANOMALIES IN HVAC/BMS SCENARIOS AROUND THERMAL COMFORT AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Repository for all analysis done on for the Third Year Project, containing only the scripts, no dataset is included due to confidentiality reasons. All code files are placed in the Final Codes Folder. 

Code files: 
* Cleaned Code Final: Code reproduced from previous year to get a complete dataset. Author: Angeliki Liaska, Adapted by: Zarin Haque
* EDA and Steady State Operation Detection: Filtering out when the system was on, and then exploring the distribution of variables to clean up the dataset. Includes implementation of the ordinary least squares regression technique for steady state detection. This code produces the final dataset to be used for clustering. Final Dataset contains 16958 datapoints. Author: Zarin Haque 
* Final DS analysis : Exploratory data analysis of the final dataset. Author: Zarin Haque 
* K Means analysis: Implementation of K means algorithm and analysis of its output. Author: Zarin Haque 
* DBSCAN and LOF Clustering Analysis: Implementation of both DBSCAN and LOF algorithms and analysis of their output. Author: Zarin Haque 
* Results Graphs: Visualisation of the anomaly classification for empirical analysis. Author: Zarin Haque
